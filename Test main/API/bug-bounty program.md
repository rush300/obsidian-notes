In bug bounty programs, you should pay attention to two contracts: the
terms of service for the bug bounty provider and the scope of the program.
Violating either of these contracts could result not only in getting banned
from the bug bounty provider but legal trouble as well. The bounty pro-
vider’s terms of service will contain important information about earning
bounties, reporting findings, and the relationship between the bounty pro-
vider, testers, researchers, and hackers who participate and the target.
The scope will equip you with the target APIs, descriptions, reward
amounts, rules of engagement, reporting requirements, and restrictions.
For API bug bounties, the scope will often include the API documentation
or a link to the docs. 
Table 0-1 lists some of the primary bug bounty considerations you should understand before testing.

*Table 0-1: Bug Bounty Testing Considerations*
* TargetsURLs that are approved for testing and rewards. Pay attention to
the subdomains listed, as some may be out of scope.
* Disclosure terms
The rules regarding your ability to publish your findings.
* Exclusions
URLs that are excluded from testing and rewards.
* Testing restrictions
Restrictions on the types of vulnerabilities the organization will
reward. Often, you must be able to prove that your finding can
be leveraged in a real-world attack by providing evidence of
exploitation.
* Legal
Additional government regulations and laws that apply due to the
organization’s, customers’, and data center’s locations.
