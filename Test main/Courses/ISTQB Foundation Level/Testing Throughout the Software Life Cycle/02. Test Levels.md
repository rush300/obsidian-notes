## Component Testing or Unit Testing
- Unit is the smallest testable part of the software system.
- Unit testing is done to verify that the lowest independent entities in any software are working fine.
- The smallest testable part is isolated from the remainder code and tested to determine whether it works correctly.
- STUBS and DRIVERS are used to replace the missing components in unit testing
## Integration Testing
- Integration testing tests interfaces between different components
- Integration testing tests interactions to different parts of a system like, File system, System Hardware, Operating system, Interfaces between other systems.
### Levels of Integration testing
- Component Integration Testing
- System Integration Testing
	- Done mostly after system testing is complete
### Approaches of Integration Testing
- Big bang integration testing
- Incremental Integration testing
	- Top down approach
	- Bottom up approach
		- The lowest levels components are tested first
## System Testing

- Testing the behavior of the whole software/system as defined by scope is known as system testing
- Purpose of system testing is to find as many defects as possible
- Done from independent test team
- Should be as much as possible to production environment
- Should investigate both functional and non-functional requirements of the system
- Black box techniques (Specification based)
- White box techniques (Structure based)
### System testing include test cases based on:
- Software Requirements specifications (SRS)
- Business processes
- End user scenarios
- High level description of system behaviors
- Risks involved for the system

## Acceptance testing

- Acceptance testing starts after system testing is done and all major defects are resolved
- Acceptance testing is most often responsibility of customer but other stakeholders are also involved
- The main goal in acceptance testing is to establish confidence in the system
