## Component Testing or Unit Testing
- Unit is the smallest testable part of the software system.
- Unit testing is done to verify that the lowest independent entities in any software are working fine.
- The smallest testable part is isolated from the remainder code and tested to determine whether it works correctly.
- STUBS and DRIVERS are used to replace the missing components in unit testing
## Integration Testing
- Integration testing tests interfaces between components
- 
## System Testing

## Acceptance testing
