## Software Development Models - Waterfall, V-Model, Iterative Development, RAD

## Verification(Requirements) vs. Validation
## Waterfall model
## V model
## Iterative Development model
### Rapid Application Development(RAD)
### Agile Development
		- importance of team interaction
		- preferred working software over importance of documentation
		- early feedback is key
		- ease to respond to change 
#### SCRUM
- is an Agile framework for managing product development
- is lightweight, iterative and incremental approach for product development
- Scrum is simple to understand but difficult to master
##### Instruments and practices
###### Sprint 
- SCRUM divides the project into iterations known as Spirnts
- Sprints are fixed length (2-4 weeks) for entire project duration
###### Product Increment
- Product development is done in increments
- After each sprint shippable product is delivered
###### Product Backlog
- List of all items that need to be delivered within the project
- Product owner managers and priorities the product backlog
- Product backlog evolves from sprint to sprint
###### Sprint Backlog
- The highest priority items to be delivered in Sprint are known as Sprint backlog
- Team is responsible in delivering all items in Sprint backlog
###### Definition of Done
- The Definition of Done is a checklist which defines the criteria of completion for Stories and Sprint
- Definition of done can have criteria like: No open defects for story, acceptance criteria met for story
###### Time-boxing
 - SCRUM applies time boxing to all variety of activities in Sprint
 - Meetings are time-boxed, like stand-up meetings should not be more than 15 minutes
 - Sprints are time-boxed to 2-4 weeks
###### Transparency
- development team reports the work progress on daily basis - daily stand-ups
- Task boards are setup to show the team progress
- Showcase after each sprint to demonstrate working software

#### KANBAN
- is Japanese word which means "visual signal"
- Work is represented as a card on the KANBAN board
- Members can see the state of every piece of work
- As the work is visual on board so, problems can be seen and addressed quickly
##### Three instruments in KANBAN
- KANBAN Board
- Work-in-progress limit
	- KANBAN restricts the amount of parallel activities tasks
	- There can be only allowed maximum number of tickets at one station
	- Once the station is free, the developer pulls the task from predecessor station
- Lead time
	- Lead time is measured as soon as work item is created
	- KANBAN is used to optimize the continues flow of tasks which minimizes lead time
