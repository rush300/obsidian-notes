## Component Testing or Unit Testing
- Unit is the smallest testable part of the software system.
- Unit testing is done to verify that the lowest independent entities in any software are working fine.
- The smallest testable part is isolated from the remainder code and tested to determine whether it works correctly.
- STUBS and DRIVERS are used to replace the missing components in unit testing
## Integration Testing
- Integration testing tests interfaces between different components
- Integration testing tests interactions to different parts of a system like, File system, System Hardware, Operating system, Interfaces between other systems.
### Levels of Integration testing
- Component Integration Testing
- System Integration Testing
	- Done mostly after system testing is complete
### Approaches of Integration Testing
- Big bang integration testing
- Incremental Integration testing
	- Top down approach
	- Bottom up approach
		- The lowest levels components are tested first
## System Testing

- Testing the behavior of the whole software/system as defined by scope is known as system testing
- Purpose of system testing is to find as many defects as possible
- Done from independent test team
- Should be as much as possible to production environment
- Should investigate both functional and non-functional requirements of the system
- Black box techniques (Specification based)
- White box techniques (Structure based)
### System testing include test cases based on:
- Software Requirements specifications (SRS)
- Business processes
- End user scenarios
- High level description of system behaviors
- Risks involved for the system

## Acceptance testing

- Acceptance testing starts after system testing is done and all major defects are resolved
- Acceptance testing is most often responsibility of customer but other stakeholders are also involved
- The main goal in acceptance testing is to establish confidence in the system
- Main focus should be to determine if the system is fit for purpose
### Operational Acceptance Testing
- Validates if the system meet operational requirements, it is also known as "Production Acceptance Testing"
==Types==
- Testing backups/restore
- High availability & Disaster recovery
- User management
- Testing maintenance tasks
- Periodic checks of security vulnerabilities
### Contract Acceptance Testing
- Define before signing the contract

### Compliance Acceptance Testing
- is performed against the regulations (Government, legal, safety, medical) which must be adhered to
### Alpha Testing
- Alpha testing is done at the developers site by independent test team, potential end users and stakeholders
- Alpha Testing is mostly done for COTS(Commercial Off the Shelf) software to ensure internal acceptance before moving the software for beta testing.
- Alpha testing provides feedback to the developers directly from the customers
### Beta Testing or Field Testing
- Beta testing is done after alpha testing.
- Beta testing is done by the potential or existing users, customers and end users at the external site without developers involvement
- Beta testing is done to acquire feedback from mass market
