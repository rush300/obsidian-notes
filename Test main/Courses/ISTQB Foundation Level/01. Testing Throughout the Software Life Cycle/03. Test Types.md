## Functional testing
- tests the function of the system or component
- usually described in documents such as software requirements specifications, use cases or a functional specification
- may be performed at all levels of testing
### Requirements based
- Prioritization done based on risk criteria mentioned in requirements document
### Business-process based
- describe the scenarios involved in day to day business use of system
- Use cases are very useful basis for designing test cases
## Non-functional testing
==Types==
- Performance testing 
- Lead
- Stress
- Usability
- Maintainability
- Reliability
- Portability
## Structural testing or Withe-box testing
- is done with the help of code coverage tools which asses the percentage of executable elements that have been exercised or covered
- If coverage is not 100% then additional test cases are need to written to cover those missed items
## Re-testing and Regression testing
- Confirmation testing or Re-testing comes in picture when the test fails and a defect is logged against that test
- Once the defect is fixed and new build is obtained with fixed defect re-testing is done to make sure that defect has been fixed and test passes now
- If a defect has been fixed it might have affected other areas of code. Regression testing is done to find the "unexpected side effects" of defect fixes
- Ideal for automation
