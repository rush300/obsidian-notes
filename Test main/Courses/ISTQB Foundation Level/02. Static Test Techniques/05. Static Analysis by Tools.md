- Examination of requirements, design documents or software code without executing the artifact under test is known as static analysis
- Main objective of static analysis is to find defects before coding starts and software code is actually run
- The goal of static analysis is to find defects rather than failures
- Tools mostly used by developers during unit, integration testing
## Benefits of static analysis 
- Defects are detected prior to test execution
- It is very effective in finding defects that are difficult to find by dynamic testing
- Static analysis tools give warning about any incorrect code format and structure
- Using static analysis improves maintainability of code
