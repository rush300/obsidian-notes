Some more characteristics of Microsoft Sentinel are:

- Gather data at cloud scale from all users, hardware, software, and infrastructure, both locally and across many clouds.
- Utilize Microsoft's analytics and unrivaled threat intelligence to identify threats that have previously gone undiscovered and reduce false positives.
- Utilizing years of Microsoft's efforts in cyber security, investigate threats using artificial intelligence and look for unusual activity at scale.
- With integrated orchestration and automation of routine processes, react to crises quickly.

Microsoft Sentinel includes well-known Azure services like Logic Apps and Log Analytics out of the box. AI-enhanced Microsoft Sentinel improves your investigation and detection. It allows you to bring your own threat intelligence while also providing Microsoft's threat intelligence stream.

# SIEM

Microsoft's Sentinel cloud-native SIEM solution is installed in an organization's Azure tenant and accessed through the Azure portal, guaranteeing alignment with current organizational standards.

For data-intensive applications like SIEM, the ability to use Azure's built-in elastic compute and storage capabilities is a huge benefit over premise-based log analysis systems. Additionally, Microsoft Sentinel is able to deliver features like workflow automation and long-term log retention that are generally offered as add-on services from other SIEM providers by utilizing the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) resources in Azure.

When Microsoft Sentinel interacts with Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Defender to offer a unified solution to manage risk in your digital landscape under a single umbrella, it has generated noise in the security market. Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender may share incidents, schema, and alerts to offer a comprehensive picture with seamless drill-down for context.

Let's explore the world of Microsoft Sentinel in depth to try to understand why Sentinel should be your top pick for a SIEM.

  

## Logs

The infrastructure of every organization depends on logs. Without logs, SIEMs practically cannot function. Thus, Log Analytics Workspace (LAW), where all ingested data or logs will be kept, is the first deployment need for Microsoft Sentinel. The Microsoft Sentinel resource can be configured to carry out SIEM tasks once Log Analytics has been deployed. Because Microsoft Sentinel offers an intuitive user interface, connecting it to a LAW simply involves a few clicks.

Once you're connected, Microsoft Sentinel also provides you with a large selection of log categories to select from, ensuring that you're just consuming the information necessary for your needs. Microsoft Sentinel offers you a very scalable connection with the LAW so you can flexibly change the data ingestions.

  

## Data Collection

Security executives and professionals frequently hold the false belief that Microsoft Sentinel can only be used to Azure Cloud resources. In fact, Microsoft Sentinel can be used to successfully ingest and correlate data from a variety of log sources that are present in a variety of cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud), on-premises network as well as compute infrastructure, 3rd party security tools (including firewalls), or software as a service (SaaS) applications.

Microsoft Sentinel comes with more than 100 data connectors out of the box and has the option to build custom sources to satisfy specific needs. Along with those, the Microsoft Sentinel community frequently showcases new use cases and data interfaces that increase the solution's capabilities.![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/H34GQGBiRkytoKlBKbmh)

  

## It works as a SOAR too!

Azure Logic Apps serves as the fundamental driving force behind Microsoft Sentinel's automation functionality. This capacity is known as Security Orchestration and Automated Response in terms of cybersecurity (SOAR). In reality, Azure Logic Apps power "playbooks," which are a series of actions that can be taken in reaction to a security warning.

Playbooks can assist in orchestrating and automating reaction actions that are traditionally carried out by security analysts. These can be configured to run automatically or manually when certain warnings are triggered. Additionally, automation rules make it possible to generate combinations of playbook runs and incident updates (severity, ownership, status, etc.) to match the desired output, making SOAR activity building more obvious.

  

## Productivity / Workspace

Based on KQL searches and interaction with additional Microsoft resources, the Microsoft Sentinel workbooks offer a wide range of data visualization features (via REST APIs). For the common log sources including Windows Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, Office 365, and Office, as well as third-party log sources, there are over 100 workbook templates available (e.g., firewalls, SaaS).

The workbooks offer conditional formatting, various other features often seen in analytical systems, and a variety of visualisation tools (bar, pie, area, and time charts). Workbooks can develop into incredibly useful tools with constant assessment and input from customer reports.

  

## Threat Intelligence

Threat indicators, sometimes referred to as Indicators of Compromise, are the most common type of TI within a SIEM solution like Microsoft Sentinel (IoCs). Threat indicators are information that links observed artifacts like URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses to known threat activities like malware, botnets, and phishing.

You can utilize threat indicators in Microsoft Sentinel to help identify malicious activity seen in your environment and give security investigators context for their decision-making. In Microsoft Sentinel, the analytics rules that support threat detection are the most significant use case for threat indicators. To identify security concerns in your organization, these indicator-based procedures evaluate unprocessed events from your data sources against your threat indicators.

# Active Directory

Active Directory is probably at the top of your list of sources to integrate if you're considering using Microsoft Sentinel. You definitely spend a lot of time looking over Active Directory logs if you already utilize it. On-premise Active Directory is still widely utilized despite Microsoft's drive toward Azure Active Directory. It's possible that you stopped using it for cloud workloads, but chances are that you still do so on-site. Active Directory attack and defense is such a large topic that it is essentially a specialty within cyber security.

There are several ways to onboard Active Directory logs, and each has advantages and disadvantages. This post's objective is to present your options so that you can choose one after considering all of your possibilities.

  

## Azure Monitor

- The events logged on your domain controllers will exactly match what is reported to Sentinel. If the server has recorded EventId 1234, Sentinel will keep an exact copy of it. The SecurityEvent table receives them and writes them.
- You have complete control over which EventIds you ingest. Data Collection Rules are used to do this. You can limit your search to specific EventIds. Even more detailed attributes, like process names, can be used to filter EventIds.
- To use this agent, non-Azure VM workloads must be enrolled in Azure Arc. This includes virtual machines found in other clouds as well as servers located on-site.
- What level of logging you set via your rules will affect the price.
- Events will happen almost instantly.

## Log Analytics

- The events logged on your domain controllers will exactly match what is reported to Sentinel. If the server has recorded EventId 1234, Sentinel will keep an exact copy of it. The SecurityEvent table receives them and writes them.
- The tier you select here will determine which EventIds you absorb.
- Apart from those predefined levels, there is no option to adjust the logging.
- What logging level you select will determine the price. It could be important if you select every event and you have a busy domain.
- Events will happen almost instantly.

## Defender

You can use Sentinel to leverage the Defender for Identity agent if it is installed. Defender for Identity's service allows you to send two different sorts of data to Sentinel. Defender for Identity's alerts are recorded in the SecurityAlert table.

For instance, a golden ticket usage or reconnaissance alarm. Only the alert and related entities are included here. This table does not get any actual logs.

Sentinel may freely absorb this data. Through the "Microsoft Defender for Identity" data connector, you can enable it.

It is also possible to write summarized event data back to Sentinel. If you've previously utilized Advanced Hunting, these are the identical logs that show up there. These are:

  

- IdentityLogonEvents will display logon events from Office 365 and Active Directory.
- You can view directory events such as an account being disabled or a group membership changing with IdentityDirectoryEvents.
- You can view query events such as SAMR or DNS requests using IdentityQueryEvents.
- It costs money to consume this data. The 'Microsoft 365 Defender' data connector under 'Microsoft Defender for Identity' allows you to turn it on.
- These occurrences cannot be altered in any way. Only as the Defender for Identity product develops will they be updated or changed.
- Of course, the price will vary depending on the size of your environment. However, it ought to be far lower than raw logs.
- Logs are transmitted to Sentinel after being sent to Defender for Identity service, so there is a delay.

The first two agents are therefore rather comparable. The Log Analytics agent has logically evolved into the Azure Monitor agent. You may personalize your logs when using the new one, which is a significant advantage. It is also simple to implement various collection rules. All of the asset logs from your crucial assets could be taken. Following that, you could simply select a subset of occurrences from different assets. If you choose to make use of any of it, you also gain the additional Azure Arc capability.![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ib2bUS61TfG6gvsrucGM)

Hopefully, this clarifies the alternatives. The Log Analytics or Azure Monitor agent is your only true choice if you require real-time detection. You might not be able to detect malicious activity in time due to the delay in logs being transmitted via Defender for Identity. You can pick whichever of the two agents you want.

The Azure Monitor agent is for you if you need to be able to choose which logs you want. Remember that you will need the Azure Arc-enrolled machine for workloads that are not Azure-related.

A separate set of details is provided by the Defender for Identity agent. Even if you don't have the need or money to record actual occurrences, it still has value. They are a wonderful place to start if you already use Defender for Identity and are interested in learning more about Sentinel. In comparison to the other two agencies, the cost will be considerably lower. It also saves you a lot of time by performing its own event correlation.

You can employ several agents as well. They certainly carry out comparable tasks given that the Log Analytics agent is being replaced by the Azure Monitor agent. If your needs aren't really explicit, you generally don't need both of them. However, you may undoubtedly run one of them in addition to the Defender for Identity agent. Of course, you are responsible for both ingestion fees. However, as we can see above, the traffic for Defender for Identity is not very large. If you choose that path, you will also receive the Defender for identity insights in addition to the logs for quick detection.

# Sentinel vs Splunk

First, let’s start with understanding the advantages of Microsoft Sentinel. We already know what it is, so it’s a good idea to understand our comparisons.

Microsoft Sentinel technology has a track record of success. Users not only express satisfaction with the company's security technology, but also high levels of confidence in the company's long-term plans. Microsoft Sentinel is a great option for enterprises already utilizing the capabilities of Sentinel because it is tightly integrated within the Microsoft Sentinel ecosystem. Microsoft's resources and customer support services are also available to assist Microsoft Sentinel.

Enterprise users express satisfaction with the scalability, product design, stability, and integration of Microsoft Sentinel. They are also impressed by its load balancing, analysis, and metrics collection capabilities. Although Microsoft Sentinel isn't a particularly ground-breaking new technology, it is a reliable, stable option that can support and automate many common security and management procedures.

  

## What is Splunk?

For security, IT, and DevOps, Splunk is a "data-to-everything" security platform. Security analytics and SIEM, automation and orchestration, forensics and investigation, security incident response, and unified security operations are all elements of the Splunk Security Cloud. Big data and artificial intelligence are also used by Splunk, an all-in-one security solution, to identify and reduce threats.

DevOps and other IT solutions that may be linked into the Splunk Security Cloud are a part of the Splunk IT framework, giving businesses everything they need to defend and maintain their network.

![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ovrYWqGQKCFldakihYKw)

  

## Splunk Advantages

Due of Splunk's smaller size than Microsoft Sentinel, several clients believe they receive a more individualized and straightforward approach when dealing with the business. Although the technology is not as advanced or seamlessly integrated as Microsoft Sentinel, it is nonetheless a reliable platform that is being developed. It is challenging to make a direct cost comparison between Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel because pricing details for both systems vary.

Enterprise users say they appreciate how the solution is an all-in-one, fully integrated platform. The system's users appreciate its adaptability, detailed logging, user-friendliness, and data collection the most. It's a simple, clear solution that accomplishes the majority of what a business will need to do for managing its security.

  

## Comparisons

The product portfolios of Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk are comparable. However, there are some significant variations that might influence your choice:

- In general, Microsoft Sentinel is thought to be simpler to use, configure, and administer.
- Splunk consistently receives higher marks for customer service excellence and ease of use.
- Microsoft's products, such as Network Management, Incident Management, and Security Intelligence, enjoy greater consumer trust.
- Splunk only really shines when it comes to event management and issue reporting.
- Due of Splunk's dependency on query language, learning can take a little longer.

Cost is one area that could raise some red flags for your business. Depending on your organization's size and usage, Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel have different price points. Until you have quotations from both, it might not be possible for your company to determine which will be more inexpensive for it. Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk don't offer free trials, although users can ask for walkthroughs and demos.

Overall, Microsoft Sentinel has better technology, but Splunk is a smaller company and offers advantages unique to small businesses, such customer support. Microsoft Sentinel will probably be successful for businesses that depend on its security and dependability services. Although Splunk has greater grades for the quality of assistance, it receives lower marks for the majority of its technology, and an MSP will likely still serve as the interface between your business and your solution.

Microsoft Sentinel will be more sophisticated and feature-complete for many enterprises, but every firm is unique and has distinct demands.

# In-Depth Advantages & Disadvantages

There are currently more than a hundred different Azure solutions accessible to customers, ranging from AI machine learning services to management tools that will give you app analytics that detect, assess, and diagnose potential problems in your services. Azure is intended to be your one-stop shop for development when used in conjunction with third-party tools and applications.

Here are some benefits and drawbacks to think about if you're looking more closely at Microsoft Azure for your business/company.

  

## Advantages

### Accessibility for any framework/language/tool

You can swiftly transform your ideas into solutions when Microsoft Azure is working for you. Bring your code and you can start doing what you already enjoy. Azure gives you access to tools like Visual Studio and lets you create apps in the languages of your choice, [including.NET](http://including.NET), Java, and Node.js. This enables you to continue being productive while concentrating on the coding as opposed to how it is handled.

  

### Access to all Microsoft products

With Microsoft Azure, you can link devices, data, and applications using 150+ connectors that are included with your purchase out of the box. One of the greatest connectors is Office 365, which enables you to combine programming and administration tasks onto a single platform. Dropbox, Google services, Twitter, Salesforce, and many other platforms are all compatible with Azure.

  

### Automation

With Azure, you can manage complicated, large-scale applications using the tools of your choice. BASH, Power Shell, and REST APIs are examples of this. As a result, you can easily automate your time-consuming repetitive operations to speed up the delivery of your app without sacrificing the caliber of your work. As your apps already have built-in support for analytics, patching, monitoring, backups, and site recovery, you can concentrate on your job rather than trying to maintain your infrastructure.

  

### Hybrid infrastructure

With security solutions and integrated management solutions for a hybrid infrastructure, SMBs can take control of their environment and improve visibility. You can more quickly identify and address threats in the cloud and on-premises thanks to the Azure Security Center. Additionally, you can activate backup and recovery mechanisms to safeguard against local data loss. You select the migration strategy that best suits the demands of your company. When you subscribe, Azure doesn't need you to migrate everything at once like other providers do.

  

### Artificial intelligence

The tools provided by Azure make it feasible to create a variety of AI-powered experiences. You may create chatbots that engage with customers intuitively, provide predictions more quickly, and enhance your ability to provide overall service. With these AI services, you can essentially serve a larger population, provide genuine results, and enhance the brand experience for your clients.

  

### High availability

The uptime guarantee you are granted is extremely high, according to the legal agreement that governs the services offered by Azure. That indicates that over the course of a year, you may anticipate having downtime of around 4 to 5 hours in real-time hours. For the same price as Azure, comparable services from rival companies offer uptime of very high percentages (above 90%), and occasionally as low as 90%.

  

### Strong security

The DADSC method of security is used by Azure: detect, evaluate, diagnose, stabilize, and close. You will be able to take their numerous compliance certificates and convert them into your next best assets when this profile is combined with the cyber-security controls that are integrated into the platform. Azure decreases the risk of data loss by covering both end users and the platform. In addition, application passwords and multi-factor authentication add still another level of security to prevent data theft.

  

### Scalability

Like other businesses, yours undoubtedly has one or two days when you use the most data, and the remaining days of the month, you use the least. With Azure, you are not required to buy data packets or other upgrades in order to have access to the computing power you require for that one or two days each month. Simply click on the upgrades you require, then uncheck them once you're through. Paying for only the services you use is made simpler by this framework.

![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/GhEInYhHTTqdOV5k8AIw)

  

### Cost effective

You don't need to make the same capital expenditures into IT infrastructure as other organizations because you're employing a cloud provider. For the SMB, this means having the technology necessary to rapidly compete on a global scale. You only buy what you require at the time you require it. You can launch internal or external apps in the cloud environment using Azure in exchange. Because you have access to the cloud, you may do without the expense and upkeep of hardware without giving up the advantages of having it.

  

### Maintaining data access

You will be able to access your data thanks to Microsoft Azure's availability to a wide variety of international data centers. They achieve continuous availability at higher levels than their competitors in this way. You can simply access another data center when you need to put data in or take it out for your business, so even if one of the data centers needs to be shut down for maintenance, everything will still work as usual.

  

## Disadvantages

### Ease of access might be problematic

Today, it is quite easy to open a cloud account, therefore an empowered person with spending authority might authorize a Microsoft Azure account without the company's management or ownership first giving their consent. Despite the fact that Azure is used by the vast majority of Fortune 500 firms, not every company, especially young startups or SMBs, will find it to be a good value. You should carefully evaluate your expenditure structures before starting your business to prevent this problem.

  

### Speed might be an issue

When all 54 declared Microsoft Azure regions are taken into account, availability is provided to 140 different nations. You're good to go if you reside in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, Japan, or China. Rapid data access is advantageous for your company. However, if you are in South America, there is just one location that is accessible to you; it is known as "Brazil South." Africa has two announced areas but none that are currently operational. There are just two regions in Canada, both of which are in the east. If there isn't a nearby area, speed is definitely a problem.

  

### Forces you to put your focus in one area

Microsoft Azure suggests a single vendor strategy for your company. Although using a single provider makes things more convenient, it also puts you at danger. What would happen if Microsoft was unable to uphold their end of the bargain when your data was managed by a single supplier who also served as your launch platform? Even if you have a legal claim to make, you won't have access to your data. That can be an unneeded risk that some SMBs cannot afford to accept.

  

### Platform expertise

A change in the amount of processing power that the company can use is one of the major problems with Azure. Your computer capacity might not transfer with you if you switch from on-premise servers to the cloud. You might find that the charges are several thousand dollars more year than what you're paying now to generate the same levels of processing power on this cloud-based platform.

  

### High management necessity

You'll still need someone to efficiently handle your data even if you'll be spending less up front on local IT infrastructure and maintenance. You cannot administer your cloud-based data center using Microsoft Azure. As a result, you'll require on-the-ground personnel who are knowledgeable in using Azure, including server monitoring and patching. You have to either learn it yourself or come up with another alternative if you don't have the talent.

![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/3MTQYINSwu58sQ6dAECQ)

Companies are migrating their data to cloud-based services at a faster rate than ever before. It can be challenging to decide which service to utilize. With these Microsoft Azure benefits and drawbacks, you can decide whether or not this IaaS platform can satisfy your demands both now and in the future.

# Workspace Architecture

You must create your Log Analytics workspace architecture as you plan the deployment of your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Business and technological needs are often what guide decisions about workspace architecture. This article examines important deciding elements to assist you in choosing the ideal office architecture for your businesses, including:

- Whether you plan to use one tenant or several tenants
- Any legal specifications that must be followed when collecting and storing data
- How to manage who has access to the data in Microsoft Sentinel
- The financial effects of various situations

## Occupation-related factors

Even though it's easier to manage fewer workplaces, you can have certain requirements for a variety of tenants and workspaces. As an illustration, many businesses have a cloud infrastructure with several Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants as a result of mergers and acquisitions or owing to the need for identity separation.

Consider that almost all Microsoft Sentinel features operate by using one workspace or Microsoft Sentinel instance, so that Microsoft Sentinel ingests all logs held within the workspace when deciding how many tenants and workspaces to employ.

In order to support built-in, service-to-service data connectors that are only functional within their respective Azure AD tenant, if you have several tenants, such as if you're a managed security service provider (MSSP), we recommend that you construct at least one workspace for each Azure AD tenant.

A workspace that is not in the same tenant as the resource cannot be connected to by any connectors based on diagnostics settings. This holds true for connectors like Azure Active Directory, Azure Firewall, and Azure Storage.

  

## Considerations for Compliance

Compliance can become a key design requirement after your data has been gathered, saved, and processed, having a substantial impact on your Microsoft Sentinel architecture. For many nations and areas, it is essential to be able to check and demonstrate who has access to what data at all times. For many customers, Microsoft Sentinel workflows make it easy to assess risks and gain insights.

With rare exceptions, such as when utilizing detection algorithms that utilize Microsoft's Machine learning, data is typically kept and analyzed in the same geographic area or region in Microsoft Sentinel. In some circumstances, data may be copied for processing outside of your workplace geography.

![](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gP6wBaWGSoKUFkVTR51Z)

  

## Considerations for Regions

For each location, use a different instance of Microsoft Sentinel. Despite the fact that Microsoft Sentinel can be used in several regions, you could need to split your data by team, region, or location, or you might be subject to laws and constraints that make multi-region models difficult or more complicated than necessary. To reduce bandwidth and egress costs while moving data between regions, use distinct instances and workspaces.

When working with various locations, keep the following in mind:

- When the Log Analytics or Azure Monitor agent is required to gather logs, such as on virtual machines, egress costs usually apply.
- You might not be impacted by Internet egress unless you export data outside of your Log Analytics workspace. If you export your Log Analytics data to an on-premises server, for instance, you can be charged for internet egress.
- The cost of bandwidth varies according to collection technique, source, and destination regions.
- Make your deployments more effective by using templates for your analytics rules, custom queries, workbooks, and other resources. Instead of individually deploying each resource in each location, deploy the templates.
- Diagnostics-based connectors don't have to pay for extra bandwidth.

You will be charged ingress fees for the data transmission, for instance, if you choose to gather logs from Virtual Machines in the East US and transport them to a Microsoft Sentinel workspace in the West US. The size charged for the bandwidth may be smaller than the size of the logs in Microsoft Sentinel because the Log Analytics agent compresses the data while it is in transit.

## Lesson Summary

Splunk is highly regarded for its customer assistance, but its technology is not as highly rated. To bridge this gap, it is recommended to use a managed service provider as the middleman between your business and the Splunk solution.

On the other hand, Microsoft Sentinel is a more comprehensive option with advanced features. The choice between Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel depends on the unique needs of your organization.

Microsoft Azure offers a wide range of solutions and tools, making it accessible for any framework, language, or tool. It also provides access to all Microsoft products and has automation capabilities.

Azure offers several advantages, including hybrid infrastructure, artificial intelligence tools, high availability, strong security measures, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, there are also some drawbacks to consider, such as ease of access, limited speed in certain regions, reliance on a single vendor, platform expertise requirements, and high management needs.

When planning the deployment of a Microsoft Sentinel workspace, it is important to consider factors such as whether to use one or several tenants, compliance requirements, and regional considerations.

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native solution that offers event management, security data, and security response automation. It provides enterprise-wide threat information and intelligent security analytics. It can gather data from various sources, on-premises and in the cloud, and uses analytics and threat intelligence to identify threats. It also offers automation and orchestration capabilities for routine processes. Microsoft Sentinel integrates with other Azure services like Logic Apps and Log Analytics. It can be used as a SIEM solution and is compatible with different log sources.

Splunk is another security platform that provides security analytics and SIEM capabilities. While both Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk have similar features, Microsoft Sentinel is considered simpler to use and administer, while Splunk excels in event management and issue reporting.

In terms of cost and pricing structures, both solutions may vary depending on the size and usage of the organization.

Overall, Microsoft Sentinel is a reliable and scalable solution that tightly integrates into the Microsoft ecosystem, while Splunk offers a more personalized approach and strong customer support. The choice between Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk will ultimately depend on the specific needs and preferences of the organization.

# Conclusion
