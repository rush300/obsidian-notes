 Now let's talk about some real world breaches and understand how these attacks were executed, what made them successful and what harm was done through it.

We'll go through many examples. I want to be clear that this is not finger pointing. Each of these companies employed the correct technologies for securing their networks, their infrastructure, and their applications. But it just goes to show how clever attacks can be in finding vulnerabilities and weaknesses in APIs. You'll see many different examples here - such as Coinbase, where there was unauthorized trading possible through a vulnerable API. Or at Instagram where you could take over any user's account through an API attack. As well as examples like T-Mobile, where the exposure was not only the loss of data, but the need to report the incident to a Federal regulator. Or in the case of Optus, where the impact was a ransom demand.

So there's really a lot of different ways that API attacks can achieve their intended goals.
