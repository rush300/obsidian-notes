Next we have Instagram - an example of an API exploit that allowed a full account takeover. What happened was an API that could be exploited to help reset a particular user's password. If you're a user of Instagram and you've forgotten your password, you would hit the reset password button. It would send an email to that user with a six digit code. It turns out that the six digit code can be supplied through an API back to the Instagram server in order to reset the account.

The attacker requested a reset code of another user. Of course they did not receive it in their email. Instead they attempted to brute force all 1 million combinations of that code. Instagram, though, had some rate controls. They limited the number of guesses to 200 per IP address. But they did not limit the number of guesses across multiple IP addresses. What this researcher discovered was they could simply rotate IP addresses after every 200 guesses, utilizing up to 5,000 different IPs to get through all one million combinations and effectively take over any user's account.Â 

What needed to be in place here was an expiration of the reset code, and a prevention of mass requests on that same account from multiple IP addresses.
