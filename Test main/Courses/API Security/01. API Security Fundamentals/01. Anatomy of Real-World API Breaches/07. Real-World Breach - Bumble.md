The next one weâ€™ll discuss is Bumble, the dating app. In this case, 95 million users account information was harvested.

First, the API lacked authentication. That's a loss to broken authentication or weak authentication. In addition, the attacker discovered the use of incremental IDs. All 95 million users had an ID that was simply an incrementing digit. This is a poor practice because you want to make it difficult to enumerate IDs to harvest data. Having user 001 followed by 002 and 003 makes it easy for data harvesting to happen. You want to employ randomized identifiers with numbers and letters to make it difficult to increment through the database.

In addition, the data returned was very detailed and even included the distance from the requester to the user being searched. This particular attacker was crafty and decided to create three different accounts and they could literally triangulate and find the exact, pinpoint location of every user on the platform.

But beyond that, was an OWASP number 5 issue, which is Broken Function Level Authorization. Beyond being able to access the records - the attacker had function level access, I.e., functions like Update and Delete and so forth - functions that should not have ever been available to an end user. He could even change an account type from, say, a free, unpaid account to a paid premium account, without making any payments whatsoever. They could do this for any user on the platform. And so they could access not only the data, but also the functional capabilities, and the ability to manipulate the data itself.
