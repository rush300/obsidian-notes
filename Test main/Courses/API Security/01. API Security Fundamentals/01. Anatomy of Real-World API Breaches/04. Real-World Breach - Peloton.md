##### [Anatomy of Real-World API Breaches](https://university.apisec.ai/products/api-security-fundamentals/categories/2152504688)

In this case they had an API that they must have not expected anyone to use because it had no authentication on it - literally wide open to the outside world, if you were clever enough to find it and to attempt to use it. A researcher notified Peloton about this and after some time Peloton added the authentication to the API endpoint. What was interesting was not only could the researcher see all four million users records through the open endpoint, but even if a user had marked their account as private (and not to be discoverable by other users on Peloton) the API would ignore that. The API had full access to the entire database regardless of whether a user had marked their records as private, including those of the President as well.

In response, Peloton added authentication to this API and ensured that users were required to validate who they were. Gaining valid credentials was not difficult to obtain - but did not address the underlying authorization issue. Even though users were now required to authenticate, they could still access all four million users. This is an example not only of OWASP number 1, but also OWASP number 2, Broken Authentication. The fact that that API endpoint was left unsecured to begin with is a vulnerability and an exposure.
