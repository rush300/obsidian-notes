We'll go quicker through the rest of these, but each has a unique story. The next one is the US Postal Service. They had an API called Informed Visibility where anybody could sign up and gain access to their account information, their mail scans and other details. The Postal Service had an annual requirement to perform a web vulnerability scan on their application. They did discover some APIs that lacked authentication, which they fixed and concluded the site was now in compliance.

However, they did not fully test the APIs themselves, because shortly thereafter an attacker discovered that not only could they setup an account and properly authenticating - but once they were in, they could not only see their own records, but they could see the records of their next door neighbor or Michael Jordan or anyone with an address in the system. This is another example of OWASP number 1, where User A is able to access the records of, in this case, 60 million other user accounts. Although they were authenticating users - they were not authorizing users and controlling what those users could see.
