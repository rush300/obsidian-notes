Next on the list is Venmo. You're probably familiar with Venmo, the payment platform. On the homepage, they would present real time transactions or the most recent 10-20 transactions as they were happening. They made sure to strip out identifiable information such as last names and descriptions and things like that.

A researcher looked at this and decided to sniff the traffic between the homepage and the backend and identified an API that was powering this feature. He decided to try to call that API directly - and it worked, and did not require authentication. So that's an OWASP number 2 violation. But what he discovered was the API would return not anonymized data, but all the non-anonymized data - details of the sender and the recipient, the description, the dollar amounts. All of that information was returned to the requester. That's an example of a Broken Object Property Level Authorization, or excessive data exposure.

The use case for the homepage was to show only anonymized data - but used an API that would return non-anonymized data. The filtering was happening in the UI, not at the app level. And that's where filtering should have been addressed. Beyond that, this researcher discovered that they could write a short script and ping the Venmo server up to 115,000 times a day. By distributing requests across two different IP addresses, and over time ratcheting that up, they harvested 200 million transactions in full detail. And that's OWASP number 4, which is Unrestricted Resource Consumption - which has to do with high volume, unrestricted, uncontrolled access to vast amounts of data and resources. So there were no controls to prevent mass harvesting from occurring on the Venmo platform.
