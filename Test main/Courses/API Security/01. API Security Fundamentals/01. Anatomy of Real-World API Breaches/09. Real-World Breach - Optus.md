Optus is a large telco in Australia. They had a massive breach and, as you can see, vulnerable APIs were to blame. Again, an API endpoint with no authentication -  which is an OWASP number 2 violation. They were able to harvest 9.8 million user details, including things like driver's licenses, Medicare IDs, name, phone, email, and more - an example of a loss due to massive data harvesting. 

What’s different is what they chose to do with this data. The attacker’s goal was to ransom the data to Optus and demand a $1 million dollar payment for not exposing or publishing this information. They went on the Dark Web and released 10,000 samples of the data, proving they had legitimate user data, and demanded a million dollar payment to prevent the full disclosure of all the data.
