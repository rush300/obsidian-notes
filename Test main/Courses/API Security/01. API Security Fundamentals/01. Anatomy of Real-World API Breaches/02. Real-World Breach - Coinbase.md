We'll start with Coinbase. We'll go into a little more detail on this one because there's a lot to know and it's a quite interesting example. Coinbase is the crypto trading platform - a security researcher discovered a vulnerability that effectively allowed them to sell crypto that they did not own. For this, they were rewarded with the largest bug bounty that they've ever paid. What you see here on the bottom left is the Tweet in which he announces that just sold Bitcoin, a pair he does not have access to and does not hold. 

What they did was look at the traffic between the web interface and the backend. They basically reverse-engineered or sniffed the traffic between the application and the backend and identified the API calls. They identified four parameters in that call, which I'll show you on the next screen. He was able to manipulate those parameters to trade crypto on an account that did not belong to him.

Below you’ll see these red boxes on each of these slides indicating what type of OWASP attack this maps to. IIn this case this is OWASP number 1, which is very common, known as Broken Object Level Authorization. We'll talk a lot more about that in the OWASP section.

But let's dissect this a little bit further. Here is what he was able to see in the traffic. You'll see here in the yellow box the four items, the four elements of a transaction. So there was 1) the product ID, which is what he was trading, 2) the order, in this case, a sell order, and then 3) a source account and 4) a target account. He effectively overwrote the source account to be an account that did not belong to him. This is not something you could even possibly do through the web interface - but in an API call, you can construct any type of request that you like. He simply changed the source account from, from user A to, to user B. And down below is the confirmation of his successful transaction.

At this point, he knew he had found a very significant flaw - he contacted the company and the company did a very fine job of reacting. The first thing they did was to shut down the service, recreate the issue and then to issue a fix. By the next day the site was back up. They also blogged about it.

And what was interesting was that they were very clear about the issue. The cause of the bug was a missing logic validation check in there in their brokerage application. The app was not confirming that the user submitting the transaction owned the accounts related to the transaction. This is a classic BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) flaw where User A is able to act on behalf of User B.

When this researcher tried the same request the following day, he got an error - and as you can see here “source account does not match product ID.” They were able to insert the logic into the application to prevent that type of activity from happening. But until it had been discovered, that was a vulnerability waiting to be exploited.
