##### [Anatomy of Real-World API Breaches](https://university.apisec.ai/products/api-security-fundamentals/categories/2152504688)

Our last example is Experian. This is very interesting because this reveals the exposure and the risk that APIs can have from third parties. Experian is a credit reporting agency - what they did was create an API to provide to their financial partners (banks and loan approvers, etc.). And one of their many partners decided to take that API and publish a website where loan applicants could look up their credit scores. This website was utilizing the Experian API. 

That site was discovered by a researcher, who then sniffed the traffic, identified the API, and saw that it was an Experian API. They decided to try to call the API directly (not through the website), which it permitted - i.e., not authentication required. What was interesting was that with only an individual's name, address and date of birth, they could look up the credit score of any user in the entire Experian database. But it turned out that the date of birth field was not utilized. You could put any values you wanted - including all zeroes - and the Experian database would respond with the credit records of any users that they had.

This is an example of OWASP number 9, Improper Inventory Management. This is about having a full and accurate knowledge of your APIs, where they are, how they're being used and making sure that your APIs are not being abused by third parties in ways that you don't authorize. 

So that wraps up our real world examples. What you see are a lot of commonalities across the many breaches. There are many examples of broken authentication, where inadequate security is used. We see a lot of Broken Object Level Authorization, where you might be authenticating users, but then giving them access to records that they shouldn't be able to see. There's a lot of data harvesting and data exposure with high volumes of sensitive data coming back. And the risk that third parties can create as well.
