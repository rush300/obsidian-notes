Next is T-Mobile. In this case, we don't know much about what happened. But what we do know (from here at the bottom), is that a bad actor was able to obtain data through a single API without authorization. We know that “without authorization” means there is a Broken Authentication or a lack of authentication (OWASP number 2). In this case, the exposure was 37 million users of the T-Mobile service.

This resulted in the need to file documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission to inform of the breach and provide details. I'm sure there are also breach notification requirements for each one of those users. So the impact here goes beyond the loss of data - but there's also a reputational risk, reputational damage and even the need to file with the regulatory governing body.
