 Moving into the second half of the OWASP API Security Top 10, we've got #6, which is a new entry for 2023, Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows. It's the first time the Top 10 specifically mentions business risk that can be exposed from vulnerable APIs.

 The description here is this is an abuse of a legitimate business workflow through some sort of manipulation, excessive use, automated use or other. A lot of times the standard rate limiting caps and other types of technologies to prevent high volume transactions and can be defeated, or bypassed. So that doesn't necessarily protect you from this type of vulnerability. Things like rapid IP rotation, clearing cookies and other, distributed attacks can get around those types of defenses.

The exposure here is often a result of some kind of application logic flaw, or the application logic does not detect and prevent this type of abuse from happening.

The risk here, the exposure is definitely fraudulent transactions, loss of critical business activity, loss of revenues and certainly much more.

A couple of good examples. Probably the most obvious is mass automated purchasing. So new model of sneakers goes live or there's concert tickets that go for sale at a certain time. Can that API be abused to effectively purchase the entire inventory and lock out the legitimate market from being able to access your services, your goods your products.

Or things like high volume referral bonuses. So if you give rewards to users for performing certain activities, can that activity be abused, and manipulated and taken advantage of by users who want to create hundreds, thousands, millions of transactions and put your business at risk through those fraudulent transactions.

In terms of prevention here definitely want to identify what those business flows are, what those critical business flows are.

Make sure that you're implementing logic and controls to detect fraudulent traffic, but also to prevent successful execution of transactions from that fraudulent traffic. You do want to test and make sure that those controls are working properly. That there isn't the ability to purchase, your entire inventory of goods or products through high volume transactions and the like. So make sure you're testing and verifying that your controls are working as expected.
