Let's talk through the OWASP API Security Top 10. You may have heard of the OWASP before. It is the Open Web Application Security Project. There are two different OWASP Top 10s. So just make sure you're aware of which one you're talking about.

The classic OWASP Top 10, here on the left, is for web applications. And this has become the standard for developers and security teams to understand the types of risks that exist with their web applications.

In 2019 the OWASP group determined that with the adoption of APIs, there was a need for an API-specific Top 10 - and that's what you see on the right. The API Security Top 10 was first issued in 2019. There's some overlap with the Web App Top 10, but a whole lot of new unique requirements for the API Top 10. In 2023, a new edition of the OWASP API Top 10 was released. And that's what I'll talk about here in the coming slides.

Â This is what the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10 looks like. There's some renaming and some merging of categories and some entirely new categories that have been added.
