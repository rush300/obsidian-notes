 Moving on to the next element of the 3 Pillars of API Security - Testing. And here the goal is to ensure that your APIs are free of vulnerabilities, lack business logic flaws, etc. The first question is where do you want to find API vulnerabilities? Do you want to find them pre-production or in production? Naturally, the best practice is to make security testing part of your overall testing program. Virtually every line of code gets tested for functionality, for unit testing and for performance. It should also be getting tested for security as part of your CI/CD pipeline so that every single release gets evaluated.

Now the “standard playbook” of security tests tends to look at things like cross-site scripting, injections, buffer overflow attacks and the like. There are lots of ways to find these. And they are important tests to run. But, if you recall from the earlier section on those real world breaches, none of those were a result of an injection or a cross-site scripting. For the most part they resulted from logic flaws in the application themselves. So you need to make sure that your testing program looks way beyond the standard playbook type of tests, to the unique functionality of your application.

 We're big proponents of what we call API-First testing. Historically, application testing has focused on the UI layer itself, whether it's web app or a mobile app. But what attackers are doing is simply going around that, right to the API itself. You saw that in many of the examples that we shared earlier.

And this is why I like this quote from our good friend, Corey Ball, who created and wrote the Hacking APIs book and created our Pen Testing course. Web or API flaws are getting missed by the standard tests. It's not injections that are causing these breaches. It's lack of authentication. It's lack of authorization. It's vulnerabilities like that that are exposing data in vast quantities from, from sites. It's not really an abuse of the UI layer. It's an abuse of the API layer. So we strongly recommend this concept of API-First testing.

And that's why we created the API Pen Testing course on APIsec University. The main point here is to show you how extensive the skill set and the testing needs to be. You can see on the right hand side the course goes through things like how to perform API reconnaissance - this is what hackers are going to do against you. How to analyze the endpoints and scan them for vulnerabilities. How to perform authentication and authorization attacks. Looking for Improper Asset Management - old versions, unsupported endpoints and out of date documentation. Mass Assignment attacks where you're modifying records and changing functionality. Performing injection attacks and doing high rate limit type of attacks as well. And then combining them all together into more sophisticated attacks. 

So for folks who need to develop those types of skills, this is a great resource. It's totally free. We provide full certification - highly recommended to develop this type of skill set to understand the security posture of your APIs.

And when you're looking at what kinds of things you should be testing for - this is by no means comprehensive, but gives an idea of the type of testing and coverage that you need, broken into these three categories.

From a security standpoint looking for, on security endpoints and authentication exploits, enumeration like incrementing IDs, looking for rate limit issues and lack of encryption, fuzzing and the server side request forgery, properties leaks - all that falls into the API Security category. 

Then you've got Data Security type of tests. Who's got access? What controls are in place? Are there gaps in those controls? Are we returning too much data? Are we returning sensitive data? Are we exposing file structures and directories? Are we encrypting the data? How can data get exfiltrated from our platform?

And then over on the far right we have Business Logic - this is what's unique to you. What are the business flows that your application enables? How can those APIs be abused? What access controls do you have in place to make sure user A can't access user B's functionality? And doing penetration testing regularly and in an automated fashion on every release.
