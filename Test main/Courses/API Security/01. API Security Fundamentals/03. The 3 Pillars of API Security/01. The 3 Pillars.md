We'll now move into the 3 Pillars of API Security. As I mentioned earlier on, the 3 Pillars of API Security are Governance, Testing and Monitoring. We'll dig into each one of these individually. Governance is about defining, establishing and enforcing the processes of developing APIs, testing APIs, and getting them into production in a consistent and secure way.

Testing is about ensuring that your APIs perform as expected and are free of vulnerabilities or other flaws that can be exploited.

And then Monitoring is about runtime monitoring of those APIs to make sure they're behaving as expected, there arenâ€™t attacks in process that are succeeding or other anomalous behavior on your APIs.
