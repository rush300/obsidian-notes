Let's focus on Governance first. The benefits of governance is about establishing consistency. It's consistency in how your APIs get developed, how they get deployed, how they get tested and everything else. Setting expectations for your engineering team - what is required? What are those documentation requirements and authentication policies and, and versioning and so forth. Establishing standard processes for how APIs move from development into production in a consistent way. And enforcing security to make sure that nothing moves into production that hasn't gone through the same level of security assessment and vetting.

There are two components to governance. There's an Awareness side - which is about having proper visibility into what APIs do you have, what infrastructure are they running on, what data do they have access to, and what risks do these APIs bring along with them. And then there's a Policy and Process side, which is about how we go about the development of our APIs? How do we go about deploying them? What documentation, what design requirements do we have for these applications?

So on the awareness side this is really about knowing your APIs. Gaining a full inventory of your APIs. Why do they exist? Who owns them? How are they documented? What functionality do they offer? Where are they? All of that is granular information.

You want to have a comprehensive view across all your APIs. You want to know your infrastructure, the app architecture, the containers and virtual machines, the databases being connected to the network infrastructure. Have a good understanding of how everything interconnects.

You want to standardize your deployment process so that APIs only get deployed in approved ways with proper validation. Nothing gets out there without following the process. No “shadow” or “rogue” APIs as it's often called. Frankly, if that's happening, you've got weak governance. There should be no ability for APIs to get into production without your knowledge, without going through these proper channels. The best way to enforce this is through use of an API gateway or marketplace - so you have a central control point where all APIs are being managed properly, and that they've gone through the proper validation steps.

Definitely make API documentation mandatory. This is critical for the use of those APIs across the engineering organization, or even with your third party clients and Partners. It also is critical for testing and validation in Security. So make it mandatory and define the documentation requirements and create Design Guides for API development so that these APIs get developed and produced in a consistent and reusable manner.

The next element of awareness is risk and threat modeling. You want to understand the nature of your APIs - what are they, what business flows do they power, what data do they have access to, who has access to it, roles and access controls, etc.. You also want to assess your risk - what vulnerabilities exist, what logic flaws, what access third parties have. You want to make sure you have a proper understanding of the security posture of your APIs.

Then look at the probability of attack. Is this data highly sensitive and highly valuable, or is it fairly benign and low value to an attack? That will help you with your prioritization and understanding the impact - what's the nature of an exploit, what damage, what kind of loss, what consequences can result? 

And then finally, define a response plan. How are you going to respond to an attack when it happens? And how will you address those risks?

So then moving on to documentation. This is worthy of its own chapter in the training here. We run across many organizations where the documentation is patchy or incomplete or non-existent. It's absolutely crucial to be documenting your APIs properly. It's not only important for security, it's also important for development and for enabling the use of those APIs.

The Open API Specification, known as OAS or formerly known as Swagger, is really the industry standard for documenting REST APIs. It looks like machine readable content - typically YAML or JSON. It doesn't only help integration and enable use of your APIs, but it also aids in security. Testing can be built around your API documentation, and even runtime monitoring can be aided with this documentation.

You want to control your documentation so you know what you're publishing publicly on the internet has only the documentation that's required to be published publicly. There are very easy ways to find Open API Specifications on organization websites. So find what those are that you're publishing. Make sure you're only publishing what deserves to be out there and that you're retiring old documentation. This is a huge threat factor - attackers are looking for it. And you want to make sure you're not keeping content out there that can be used against you.

The documentation itself will define everything about your API - the functionality of the endpoints, the description, where the API exists, the base url, all the endpoints, the payloads, authentication requirements, the input parameters and data types, what methods are supported. And you want to generate this specification as much as possible through automation. You want to instrument your code repost to automatically generate this API specification. Insert the necessary comments and details into the repost to make sure that that documentation comes out as complete as possible.

And just to show you what it can look like, on the left hand side is the raw YAML, or JSON, of a Swagger. There are plenty of Swagger parsers or Open API Spec parsers, which will turn that into what you'll commonly see on API portals that you might employ on your own public website. It will help a consumer of your API understand in plain English and visual interfaces what your API does. But over on the left hand side, you'll see what the machine readable versions of these documentations look like.

From a Design Guide perspective - you really do want to establish standards for your organization - how you will authenticate users, what type of authentication, where you use different types of authentication. You want to define authorization, how you control who has access to what, and where you will enforce that. Even things like naming conventions - typically you want your URLs to be nouns and the Methods to be the verbs, whether you're Posting a new record or Putting a new value in or Deleting things - pluralization and hierarchy, language, lack of jargon. Your error codes should include status codes, reference IDs and human readable messages, but make sure those messages aren't revealing useful information back to a potential attacker. If you've got an error code, you don't want to have the error code say, for example, you're expecting a certain type of data. That’s simply informing an attacker how to attack your API. Things like versioning - when to increment, when not to. Units and formats and standards.

I poked around and found this on the Atlassian site. Here's an example of their design guide for authentication. So every REST API must have, at minimum, basic user authentication, authorization is not handled at the API layer - it's the responsibility of the application itself. That's all defined right here in their design guide.

Similarly, they have a section on, on versions. When do you need a new version, when do you not need a version, what happens to the old versions. These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about and defining proactively.
