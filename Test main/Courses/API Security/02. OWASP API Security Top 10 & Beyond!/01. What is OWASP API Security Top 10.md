The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that was created to help improve application security. The OWASP Foundation launched on December 1st, 2001, and is most well known for the Top Ten lists, open source tools, and other security projects.

The OWASP API Security Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks for Application Programming Interfaces. The founders of the project include Erez Yalon and Inon Shkedy. The OWASP API Security Top 10 was originally released in December 2019 and was driven by several key factors.

1. **The Rapid Rise of APIs**  
    APIs power the flow of the world's most valuable resource, data. A business no longer needs to specialize in all aspects of creating software, instead, they can use the features of software shared by other companies. Historically, the issue with doing this was the disconnected nature of different programming languages. Web application programming interfaces allowed for a common method to consume or provide data across the Internet. Since the widespread adoption of web APIs, organizations have been enabled to leverage the functionality of other applications. Instead of having to develop custom software for maps, GPS, payment processing, authentication, communication, and much more, developers can leverage APIs to use the functionality of other applications that specialize in that given area. APIs are a major business enabler, which explains the global rapid adoption. 
2. **A Major Gap in Security  
    **The final factor that compounded the effects of the other two is the fact that the tools and techniques of the past were not effective at detecting API-related vulnerabilities. The tools and techniques that were used for enterprise vulnerability management programs, web application scanners, and traditional network security monitoring tools were not designed to handle the unique challenges posed by APIs. As a result, many organizations were not adequately prepared to defend against API attacks, leaving them vulnerable to data breaches.
3. **A New Leading Attack Vector**  
    Often, when it comes to the rapid adoption of new technologies, security is an afterthought. APIs are no different. The rapid adoption of APIs led to a new attack vector that exposes data application functionality. Public, Internet-facing, APIs often bypassed all of the security measures that had grown with businesses over the past decade. An attacker no longer needs to go through the classic [MITRE cyber kill chain](https://www.sans.org/blog/cyber-kill-chain-mitre-attack-purple-team/) (bypass the firewall, gain entry to the network, pivot to a system containing data, and then exfiltrate that data). Instead, an attacker can use an insecure API and have direct access to sensitive data.

In response to the massive adoption of APIs, the security gaps introduced by API providers, and the new wave of API-related security incidents, the OWASP API Security Project published its Top 10 list. The API-focused Top 10 list provides a comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, and tools to help organizations secure their APIs and protect against API-related threats. The OWASP API Security project has become a widely recognized and respected resource for security professionals and has helped raise awareness of the importance of API security.

## How is the Top 10 Compiled?

As described by Paulo Silva, OWASP API Security project leader, the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10 list is put together by the project team based on, "[...] internal research based on publicly available data (e.g. bug bounty platforms, news)". Since the project did not receive **any data** during the call for data during the two-month window in late 2022, the Top 10 list was compiled based on the project team's research. This was not something new or different for the project, as this is Silva stated what was done in 2019.

Without datasets received from the community, the OWASP project team had to compile data based on public disclosures from bug bounty platforms and API security incidents that made it into the news. Although this dataset isn't as ideal as data compiled directly from testing hundreds of thousands of endpoints across the Internet, it does represent a sample of real-world API weaknesses. Some potential issues with applying this data:

- Bug bounty programs incentivize certain types of findings over others
- Bug bounty programs attract participant that represents a small sample of the APIs out in the wild
- Newsworthy incidents often leave security researchers without specific technical details
- Obviously, newsworthy incidents do not include all of the breaches and security incidents that are not reported or publicized

That being the case, there are lessons to be learned and risks to be aware of based on bug bounty writeups and publicized security incidents. 

If you are interested in learning more about the sources, below is a list of common websites to dive deeper into bug bounty research. In addition to these, attached to this module is a JSON extract from PentesterLand that contains all documented API writeups.

The OWASP API Security Top 10 list contains common groups of the most critical security risks to be on the lookout for based on these sources. 

## Mapped to External Sources

The OWASP API Security risks are associated with references to external sources. These sources include Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), other OWASP projects, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance. Most of the references involve CWEs. CWEs are a list of common software and hardware vulnerabilities developed by the community and hosted by MITRE. Each CWE is identified by a unique identifier or CWE-ID. This identifier can be used to refer back to a specific vulnerability.
