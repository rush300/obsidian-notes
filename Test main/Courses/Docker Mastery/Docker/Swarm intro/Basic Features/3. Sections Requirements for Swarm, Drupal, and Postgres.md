#### Swarm Multi-Node Clusters

In the last section, you setup a multi-node Swarm. **In this section I will teach using that multi-node Swarm cluster in various ways, but you can always do your part on a single-node Swarm if a multi-node is to much to build or maintain.**Â  Nearly everything in Swarm behaves the same in a single-node vs. multi-node, except that the Scheduler will assign Service Replicas to different nodes if you have more than one node in your cluster. It's up to you how and if you want to learn on a multi-node cluster.

#### Drupal and Postgres Versions

Due to recent breaking changes in Drupal, **be sure you're using the below versions in docker commands and YAML, so that it'll work as expected.** While a lecture video might show a slightly older version, know that any code examples and answer files in the course repository have been updated to reflect these versions:

1. drupal:9
2. postgres:14
