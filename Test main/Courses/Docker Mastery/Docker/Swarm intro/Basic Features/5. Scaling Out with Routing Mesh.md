- Routes ingress (incoming) packets for a Service to proper Task
- Spans all nodes in Swarm
- Uses IPVS from Linux Kernel
- Load balances Swarm Services across their Tasks
- Two ways this works:
	- Container-to-container in a Overlay network (uses VIP)
	- External traffic incoming to published ports (all nodes listen)
- 
```bash
docker service create --name search --replicas 3 -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:2

docker service ps search
curl localhost:9200
curl localhost:9200
curl localhost:9200
curl localhost:9200
```
! This is stateless load balancing !
