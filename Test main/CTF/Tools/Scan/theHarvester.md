theHarvester is a simple to use, yet powerful tool designed to be used during the reconnaissance stage of a red  
team assessment or penetration test. It performs open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine  
a domain's external threat landscape. The tool gathers names, emails, IPs, subdomains, and URLs by using  
multiple public resources that include:

```bash
theHarvester -d srnmck3l.vulnbegin.co.uk -b all
```
